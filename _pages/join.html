<h1>Join</h1>

I work with graduate students through the <li><a href="https://www.montana.edu/earthsciences/graduate-program/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earth Sciences Graduate Program</a></li>

<h3>Current Montana State University undergraduates</h3>
I generally have openings for current MSU undergrads for credit or pay through various MSU programs. Please check back in January for more detailed information or come 
to my office hours to talk.

<h3>Prospective graduate students</h3>
We do not have any current openings for funded MS or PhD students. Future openings will be advertised here!

Graduate fellowships that would be good fits for my research 
group are the <li><a href ="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/">Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship</a></li> and 
the  <li><a href = "https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program"> National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a></li>.


If you are a prospective student who received an NSF GRFP honorable mention in the past three years and you did not go to graduate school or you did an MS and are looking to do a PhD at MSU, 
you may be eligible to apply for an <li><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/egfp-nsf-epscor-graduate-fellowship-program/nsf24-588/solicitation">EGFP</a></li>. Please reach out via email if you are in this situation and would like to discuss opportunities at MSU.

<h3>Prospective postdocs</h3>
We do not have any current postdoc recruitments. 

If you are interested in developing a proposal to secure funding to join the group, please reach out with your current CV, graduate timeline, and a brief description 
of the proposal idea you would like to develop. See the following links for possible postdoc funding avenues: <br>
<li><a href = "https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ear-pf-earth-sciences-postdoctoral-fellowships"> NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowships</a></li>
<li><a href = "https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc"> NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctorala Fellowship</a></li> [Note that this program was paused in 2025 - please check
the most up-to-date information you can find]
